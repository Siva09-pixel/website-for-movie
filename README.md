# website-for-movie
his web app has similar user interface like NETFLIX. The main reason behind building this web app is to implement a tries data structure to give autocomple (suggestion) feature for user & in this web app we can filter movies by searching.(uses searching algorithm).

NOTE:

If you want to see the netflix sliders and the similar ui like netflix app & want to build your own extended web app this project would be a good start.
